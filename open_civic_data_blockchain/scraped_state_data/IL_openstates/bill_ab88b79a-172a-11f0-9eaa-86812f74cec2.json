Requires any individual who is an intended parent to undergo and pass a comprehensive criminal background check and screening before any insemination or embryo transfer. Provides that failure to do so waives any presumption that the person is the legal parent of any resulting child born through assisted reproduction. Prohibits an individual who is an intended parent from becoming the legal parent of a child resulting from the use of assisted reproduction if the intended parent has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to or nolo contendere to a list of criminal offenses. Makes the same changes to the Gestational Surrogacy Act. Amends the Illinois Fertility Fraud Act. Creates a cause of action against a health care provider by a child born as a result of assisted reproductive treatment if the health care provider failed to conduct a comprehensive criminal background check and screening of the child's intended parents that would have revealed that the intended parent had been convicted of or pled guilty to or nolo contendere to any specified violations and that child later suffered sexual abuse or sexual assault by that intended parent."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with Secretary by Sen.

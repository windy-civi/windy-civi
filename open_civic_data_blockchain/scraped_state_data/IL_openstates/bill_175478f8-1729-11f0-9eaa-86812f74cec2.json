Removes language providing that: each State university shall report annually to the Board on programs of instruction, research, or public service that have been terminated, dissolved, reduced, or consolidated by the university, and all programs of instruction, research, and public service that exhibit a trend of low performance in enrollments, degree completions, and high expense per degree; and the Board shall compile an annual report that shall contain information on new programs created, existing programs that have been closed or consolidated, and programs that exhibit low performance or productivity. Instead, requires the Board to annually identify and provide to each public university certain programs of instruction that exhibit indicators of low performance in enrollment, degree completion, and relative high expense per degree, and for each public university to review such information and report annually to the Board with its proposed performance improvement plan for each identified program. Requires the Board to report annually on the instructional programs offered at public institutions of higher education, to show number, types, and locations of instructional programs, new programs created, existing programs that have been closed or consolidated as a result of the review and report above, and other information relevant to assessing the State's portfolio of programs. Requires the report to be submitted to the General Assembly and the Governor (not only the General Assembly). Amends the Private College Act. Provides that applications submitted to the Board of Higher Education shall contain a statement, among others, regarding the tuition schedule. For a disclosure regarding heightened monitoring of the institution's finances, requires the disclosure to be made, among others, by written notice to the Board. Amends the Academic Degree Act. Requires an educational organization or entity that awards degrees and qualifies for degree granting to maintain appropriate accreditation to provide educational programming. Makes other changes.

Provides that there is a rebuttable presumption that the testimony of a victim who is a child under 13 years of age shall testify outside the courtroom and the child's testimony shall be shown in the courtroom by means of a 2-way closed circuit television (rather than closed circuit television). Provides that before the court permits the testimony of a victim outside the courtroom that is to be shown in the courtroom by means of a closed circuit television, the court must make a finding that the testimony by means of a 2-way closed circuit television (rather than closed circuit television) does not prejudice the defendant."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.

Provides that general review criteria shall include a requirement that nursing homes operated by a county, regardless of whether the nursing homes operated by a county are skilled and intermediate long-term care facilities licensed under the Nursing Home Care Act, provide a Safety Net Impact Statement. Provides that a Safety Net Impact Statement shall also be filed with an application to change ownership of a nursing home operated by a county. Includes nursing homes operated by a county in a list of safety net service providers. Provides that nursing homes operated by a county shall also provide the number of the facility's Medicaid and Medicare certified beds for the 3 fiscal years prior to the application. The State Board Staff Report shall also include a statement of findings about an application's safety net impact under specified circumstances, and that the State Board Staff's assessment shall be considered in determining whether the project fulfills the public interest requirements. Amends the County Homes Division of the Counties Code. Removes a requirement that two-thirds of the county board is required sell, dispose of, or lease for any term, any part of the home properties, and requires a referendum before selling any home (rather than requiring a referendum only for homes that were erected after referendum approval by the voters of the county). Provides referendum language for the selling, disposition of, or lease of a home. Removes language providing that, if a county nursing home was erected after referendum approval by the voters of the county, the county nursing home may be leased upon the vote of a 3/5 majority of all the members of the board."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with Secretary by Sen.

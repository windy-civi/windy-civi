Requires the Department of Children and Family Services and the Department of Human Services to adopt rules that permit a licensed child care institution or group home that provides residential developmental disability services to youth under the age of 22 to request an age waiver to allow such youth to continue to receive residential developmental disability services at the facility beyond their 22nd birthday. Requires the rules to include waiver application requirements, waiver renewals, and criteria a youth must meet to qualify for extended residential developmental disability services. Provides that a licensed child care institution or group home that receives Department approval of its waiver application shall not be issued any notice of violation or citation for providing extended residential developmental disability services to a youth within the terms of the approved waiver application. Requires the Department of Children and Family Services and the Department of Human Services' Division of Developmental Disabilities to ensure that the rates determined for extended residential developmental disability services authorized under an approved age waiver are on parity with the rates determined for residential developmental disability services provided to youth under the age of 22. Provides that nothing in the amendatory Act shall be construed to reduce the level or type of services and supports provided to a youth beyond their 22nd birthday under an approved age waiver application."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.

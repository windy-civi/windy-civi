Amends the Chicago School District Article of the School Code. Provides that at a local school council's annual organizational meeting, the local school council shall take a vote to determine if meetings shall be held in-person or remotely; however, provides that a declaration by the Governor or Director of Public Health limiting the size of or prohibiting an in-person meeting shall supersede a local school council's vote to meet in-person.

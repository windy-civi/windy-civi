In provisions concerning non-emergency transportation services for medical assistance recipients, removes a requirement that facilities complete a Physician Certification Statement prior to ordering non-emergency transportation services for a patient. Instead, requires the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to develop, subject to federal approval, a Uniform Non-Emergency Transportation Certification Form (form) for non-emergency transportation. Provides that the form shall be the only form used by and required of all facilities, physicians, transportation providers, and transportation brokers whenever a patient or person covered by the medical assistance program is being transported from a facility or personal residence and requires non-emergency transportation. Makes corresponding changes to the Nursing Home Care Act and the Hospital Licensing Act. Further amends the Medical Assistance Article with a provision authorizing transportation brokers to use a network of independent driver providers for the delivery of covered transportation services. Provides that transportation brokers and participating independent driver providers shall be subject to the same driver credentialing and licensing standards and provider registration requirements as transportation network companies (TNC) and TNC drivers enrolled in the Impact Medicaid Program Advanced Cloud Technology system. With respect to the Department's Business Enterprise Program requirements for Medicaid managed care organizations (MCO), requires each MCO to submit only one Letter of Intent that consolidates and sets forth all pending transportation services from all BEP-certified transportation providers contracted with the MCO. Requires the Department to permit a MCO's transportation broker to attest to the accuracy of all claims for services provided by a contracted transportation provider."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.

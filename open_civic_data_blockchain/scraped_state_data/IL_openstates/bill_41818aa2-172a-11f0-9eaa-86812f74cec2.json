Provides that a State entity, local entity, or law enforcement agency may not adopt or maintain a law, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, policy, directive, order, practice, or procedure, formal or informal, written or unwritten, that prohibits or materially restricts the State entity, local entity, or law enforcement agency from complying with or assisting in the enforcement of immigration laws. Includes mandatory duties of law enforcement agencies regarding immigration detainers. Requires a county jail, municipal jail, and the Department of Corrections to enter into an agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal agency for temporarily housing persons who are the subject of immigration detainers and for the payment of the costs of housing and detaining those persons. Requires implementation of the Act in a manner consistent with federal laws and regulations governing immigration and discrimination, protecting the civil rights of all persons, and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens. Limits home rule powers by providing that regulation of immigration enforcement is an exclusive power and function of the State. Repeals the Illinois TRUST Act. Makes corresponding changes in the Illinois Identification Card Act and the Illinois Vehicle Code.

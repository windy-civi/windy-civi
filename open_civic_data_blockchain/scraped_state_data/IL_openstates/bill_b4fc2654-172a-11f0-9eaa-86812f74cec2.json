Provides that out-of-school suspensions and expulsions should only be used when the student's presence poses a threat to the operation of the school, poses a threat to the health or safety of students or school personnel, or causes a disruption to other students' learning opportunities. Provides that to ensure that students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is recommended that school officials consider implementing proactive evidence-based interventions that improve behavioral outcomes for all students. Provides that out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be used only if the student's conduct poses a threat to the operation of the school, poses a threat to the health or safety of students or school personnel, or causes (rather than the student's continuing presence in school would pose a threat to school safety or) a disruption to other students' learning opportunities. Provides that the school board shall be solely responsible for determining, on a case-by-case basis, whether the student's conduct poses a threat to the operation of the school, poses a threat to the health or safety of students or school personnel, or causes a disruption to other students' learning opportunities. Provides that out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used only if other appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been attempted (rather than exhausted) and the student's conduct poses a threat to the school, poses a threat to the health or safety of students or school personnel, or causes a disruption to other students' learning opportunities (rather than the student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the operation of the school).

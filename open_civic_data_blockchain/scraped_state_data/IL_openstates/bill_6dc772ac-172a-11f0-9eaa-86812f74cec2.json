Provides that if the minor has multiple delinquency petitions filed against him or her, remaining petitions pending against the minor respondent shall be adjudicated within 120 (rather than 160) days from the date on which a finding relative to the first petition prosecuted is rendered. Restructures the provisions concerning alleged delinquent minors and pretrial detention of alleged delinquent minors. Provides that if the court determines that the State, without success, has exercised due diligence to timely obtain the results of DNA testing that is material to the case, and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the results may be obtained at a later date, the court may extend the period of detention of the minor to not more than 70 days, only for any matter for which the minor may be committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice. Provides that nothing in the trial and pretrial detention provisions of the Act prevents the minor from exercising the minor's rights to waive the time limits set forth in these provisions. Deletes provision that time needed to prepare a defense to a State motion such as an extended juvenile jurisdiction petition or a transfer petition shall not be considered a delay occasioned by the minor. Makes technical changes in the trial and pretrial detention provisions of the Act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with Secretary by Sen. Elgie R.

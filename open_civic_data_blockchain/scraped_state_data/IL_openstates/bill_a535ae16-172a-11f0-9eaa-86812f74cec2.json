Expands the definitions of \"isolated time out\" or \"time out\", \"physical restraint\" or \"restraint\", and \"time out\". Removes exceptions to the prohibition of prone restraint. Removes language providing that the parents or guardian of a student and the State Superintendent of Education shall be informed whenever isolated time out, time out, or physical restraint is used. Establishes complaint procedures to replace the complaint procedures set forth in the State Board of Education's rules. Provides that staff members responsible for implementing isolated time out, time out, or physical restraint must be trained in accordance with the system of non-violent intervention adopted by the school district and must be trained at least once every 2 years in a session that is not less than 6 hours. Requires the State Board to convene a group of stakeholders to annually review: (1) data associated with the use of physical restraint, time out, and isolated time out, and efforts made by public entities to reduce these practices; (2) strategies to reduce physical restraint, time out, and isolated time out; (3) decisions made by the State Board related to physical restraint, time out, and isolated time out; (4) student behavior and behavioral interventions that can be use as an alternative to physical restraint, time out, and isolated time out; and (5) professional development needed for public entities in behavioral interventions to ensure the proper use of physical restraint, time out, and isolated time out.

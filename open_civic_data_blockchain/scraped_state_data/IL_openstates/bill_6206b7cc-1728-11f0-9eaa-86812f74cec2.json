Beginning with fiscal year 2026, requires the General Assembly to appropriate for the evidence-based funding formula under the School Code an amount that is equal to or exceeds the sum of: (i) the total amount appropriated for the evidence-based funding formula during the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the appropriation is being made; and (ii) 51% of total new general funds available for spending from estimated growth in revenues and funds available because of budgeted program growth and decline in the fiscal year for which the appropriation is being made; but in no event shall the sum be less than a certain percentage required under the Act. Requires a continuing appropriation if the General Assembly fails to make sufficient appropriations to fund the evidence-based funding formula. Amends the School Code to make changes concerning a system for accounting for revenues and expenditures and evidence-based funding. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement.

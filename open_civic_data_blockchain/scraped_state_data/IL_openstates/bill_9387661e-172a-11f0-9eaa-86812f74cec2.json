Provides that the Illinois Labor Relations Board or the relevant panel having jurisdiction may order make-whole relief, including, but not limited to, consequential damages and front pay for injuries suffered by employees or a labor organization as a result of an unfair labor practice. Provides that, in determining appropriate relief for a violation of provisions concerning refusal to bargain in good faith with a labor organization that is serious enough to have frustrated the purposes of the Act and that may have undermined or significantly impacted the collective bargaining process, the Board shall take into consideration factors that normally determine the outcome of collective bargaining when such bargaining has been conducted in good faith. Provides that employers who commit unfair labor practices under certain provisions in the Act shall also be subject to damages in an amount equal to any monetary make-whole relief ordered by the Board unless the employer can show it acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds to believe it was acting in compliance with this Act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with Secretary by Sen.

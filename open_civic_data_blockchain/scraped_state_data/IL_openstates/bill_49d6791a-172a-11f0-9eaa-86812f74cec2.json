Provides that if any annuitant must be considered a participating employee because there was not a separation from service and the participating municipality or participating instrumentality that employs or re-employs that annuitant knowingly fails to notify the Board to suspend the annuity, the Board may review the totality of circumstances regarding the annuitant not having a separation of service and assign proportionate responsibility for reimbursement of the total of any annuity payments made to the annuitant after the date the annuity should have been suspended, as determined by the Board, between the participating municipality or participating instrumentality and the annuitant, less any amount actually repaid by the annuitant. Provides that in no case shall the total amount repaid by the annuitant plus any amount reimbursed by the employer to the Fund be more than the total of all annuity payments made to the annuitant after the date the annuity should have been suspended. Removes language providing that the provisions shall not apply if the annuitant returned to work for the employer for less than 12 months. Adds similar provisions to a provision concerning separation from service and entitlement to a retirement annuity. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with Secretary by Sen.

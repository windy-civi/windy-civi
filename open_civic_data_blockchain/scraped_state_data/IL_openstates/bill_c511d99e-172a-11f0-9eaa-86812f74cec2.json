Prohibits a health care facility or health care provider from charging or collecting a facility fee for preventive services provided to a patient, regardless of whether the patient's insurance covers the preventive service. Provides that, for any health care service other than preventive services, a health care facility may not charge or collect a facility fee not covered by the patient's insurance unless the patient is provided with written notice, as specified, of the facility fee 7 days prior to the scheduled service, or as soon as possible for unscheduled or emergency services. Requires health care facilities or health care providers to notify patients in writing, as specified, of any new business relationship with, affiliation with, or acquisition by a hospital or health system. Provides that any health care facility or health care provider that violates the Act shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $2,500 per violation, and all funds collected under the Act shall be deposited into the Facility Fee Reimbursement Fund. Provides that the Facility Fee Reimbursement Fund is created to reimburse patients who have provided sufficient evidence to the Department of Public Health that they were charged a facility fee not in accordance with the Act and to cover any administrative costs related to processing reimbursements. Grants the Department of Public Health authority to adopt rules to implement and enforce the Act. Amends the State Finance Act to make a conforming change.

In a provision concerning eligibility for total and permanent disability benefits, provides that if the participating employee was a sheriff's law enforcement employee at the time disability was incurred, the participating employee shall be deemed to have engaged in gainful activity only if that participating employee is employed as a sheriff's law enforcement employee or in a substantially similar capacity. Provides that the amount of the monthly total and permanent disability benefit shall be 100% of the final rate of earnings on the date disability was incurred if the participating employee was a sheriff's law enforcement employee at the time disability was incurred. Provides that a person who was a sheriff's law enforcement employee at the time disability was incurred may receive earnings from a participating municipality or participating instrumentality if that person is not employed as a sheriff's law enforcement employee because of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or be of a long continued and indefinite duration. Provides that such a person must report to the Fund, in a form and manner prescribed by the Fund, the amount of earnings received for that employment, and the amount of the disability benefits to which that person is entitled shall be reduced by the amount of earnings received for that employment. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement.

Provides that a unit of local government may not prohibit the building or usage of accessory dwelling units in the unit of local government. Provides that a unit of local government may provide reasonable regulations relating to the size and location of accessory dwelling units similar to other accessory structures unless a regulation would have the effect of prohibiting accessory dwelling units. Provides that, for the purposes of the Act, a regulation is considered to have the effect of prohibiting an accessory dwelling unit if it: (1) explicitly disallows the construction of accessory dwelling units; (2) imposes fees other than building permit review; (3) applies standards that would render such units inconsistent with other local land use laws; (4) imposes design, bulk, and density standards that would physically preclude the project; (5) requires off-street parking spaces; or (6) requires corrections of nonconformities of the principal dwelling unit. Provides that that a unit of local government shall approve or deny an application for a permit to create or serve an accessory dwelling unit by right and without discretionary review. Requires the unit of local government to either approve or deny the application to create or serve an accessory dwelling unit within 60 days from the date the unit of local government receives a completed application if there is an existing single-family or multi-family dwelling on the lot. Provides that, if the unit of local government has not approved or denied the completed application within 60 days, then the application shall be deemed approved unless the Act provides for additional time. Provides that, if a unit of local government denies an application for an accessory dwelling unit, then the unit of local government shall return a full set of comments to the applicant in writing with a list of items that are defective or deficient and a description of how the application can be remedied by the applicant. Provides that a unit of local government shall not deny an application for a permit to create an accessory dwelling unit due to the correction of nonconforming zoning conditions, building code violations, or unpermitted structures that do not present a threat to public health and safety and are not affected by the construction of the accessory dwelling unit.

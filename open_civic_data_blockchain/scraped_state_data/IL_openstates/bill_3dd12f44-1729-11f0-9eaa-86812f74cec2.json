Requires a hospital to ensure that the individual or entity contracted to provide health care services agrees in writing to operate under the hospital's financial assistance policy, screening obligations, collections provisions, and all other provisions of the Act, and requires a hospital to ensure that a hospital agent or on-site provider of outsourced health care services complies with the Act. Amends the Hospital Uninsured Patient Discount Act to establish similar requirements for hospitals. Provides that a hospital shall include charges from the third-party individual or entity when calculating the charge, discount, or collectible amount applicable under the Act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.

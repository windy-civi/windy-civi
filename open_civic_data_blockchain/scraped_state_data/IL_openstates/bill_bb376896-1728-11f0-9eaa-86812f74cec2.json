Requires the Department of Human Services to develop and implement a transitional benefits program for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that is designed in such a way that a SNAP beneficiary will not experience an immediate loss of benefits should his or her income exceed the maximum allowable income for the SNAP program. Provides that transitional benefits offered shall gradually step down the beneficiary's monthly benefit proportionate to the increase in the beneficiary's income thereby allowing for a transition to self-sufficiency while incentivizing work and financial stability. Sets forth how a SNAP beneficiary's transitional benefit will be determined under the transitional benefits program. Requires SNAP beneficiaries who are receiving transitional benefits to comply with all SNAP requirements, including work requirements. Makes implementation of the transitional benefits program subject to appropriation and any necessary federal waivers or approvals. Grants the Department rulemaking authority.

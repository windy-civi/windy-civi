Allows a school district to place a student in a nonpublic day facility or residential special education facility providing educational services but not approved by the State Board of Education (rather than a nonpublic residential special education facility providing educational services but not approved by the State Board of Education) if the State Board of Education provides an emergency and student-specific approval for residential or day placement.

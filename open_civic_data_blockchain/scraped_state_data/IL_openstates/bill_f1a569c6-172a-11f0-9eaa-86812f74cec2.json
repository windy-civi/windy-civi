Amends the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015. Declares it to be the public policy of Illinois that a child has the same rights and protections under law to parentage without regard to the marital status, age, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation of their parents, or the circumstances of the child's birth, including whether the child was born as a result of assisted reproduction or surrogacy. Changes the burden of proof for challenging a presumption of parentage from clear and convincing evidence to a preponderance of the evidence. Provides that a person who gave birth to a child and an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed parent under the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015, or an intended parent under the assisted reproduction provisions may sign an acknowledgment of parentage to establish the parentage of the child. Prohibits genetic testing from being used to: (i) challenge the parentage of a person who is a parent by assisted reproduction under the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015 or the Gestational Surrogacy Act; or (ii) establish the parentage of a person who is a donor. Changes the venue provisions for a proceeding to adjudicate parentage and the related notice provisions in such a proceeding. Provides that an individual who consents to assisted reproduction with the intent to be a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction is a parent of the child. Amends the Illinois Gestational Surrogacy Act. Contains provisions describing the consequences if a change in the martial status of a surrogate occurs. Sets out provisions concerning the termination of a gestational surrogacy agreement. Amends the Adoption Act. Provides a process for a confirmatory adoption for children born through assisted reproduction. Defines terms. Makes other changes.

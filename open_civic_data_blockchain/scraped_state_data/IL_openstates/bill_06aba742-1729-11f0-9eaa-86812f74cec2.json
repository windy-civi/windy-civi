Provides that there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a school bus was stopped for the purpose of receiving or discharging pupils and the visual signals were in operation on the school bus when recorded images produced by an automated traffic law enforcement system show: (1) an activated stop signal arm; and (2) an electronic indicator indicating activation of school bus visual signals. Provides that the motor vehicle owner is subject to a mandatory civil penalty of $300 (rather than a penalty not exceeding $150) for a first time violation or $1,000 (rather than a penalty not exceeding $500) for a second or subsequent violation."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.

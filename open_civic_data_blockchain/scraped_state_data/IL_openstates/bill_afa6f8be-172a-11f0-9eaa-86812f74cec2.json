In the Downstate Police Article, provides that, beginning July 1, 2025, any line-of-duty disability pension shall be at least $40,000 per year (instead of $400 per month), without regard to whether the disability or death of the police officer occurred before July 1, 2025. In provisions concerning an annual increase in the line-of-duty disability pension, removes requirements that an applicant must file an affidavit stating that the applicant has not earned any income from gainful employment during the most recently concluded tax year; have service credit in the Fund for at least 7 years of active duty; and have been receiving a line-of-duty disability pension for a period which, when added to the officer's total service credit in the Fund, equals at least 20 years. In the Downstate Firefighter Article, provides that the minimum line-of-duty disability pension shall be at least $40,000 per year. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement.

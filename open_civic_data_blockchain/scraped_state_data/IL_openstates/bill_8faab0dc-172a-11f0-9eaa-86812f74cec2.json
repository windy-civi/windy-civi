In a provision concerning the child care assistance program administered by the Department of Human Services, expands the list of families eligible to receive child care assistance to include families that are not TANF recipients but require financial assistance so that a responsible adult within the household can forgo work and care for a newborn child for the child's first 12 weeks of life. Provides that eligibility for cash assistance under the new category is conditioned on the responsible adult being the parent or legal guardian of the newborn child and participating in a Department-approved training program in health, safety, and early childhood development for the entire 12 weeks the family receives assistance. Provides that families eligible for child care assistance under the new category shall receive weekly assistance payments in an amount equal to the full day rate applied to licensed child care providers who provide 17 to 24 hours of care per day; and shall have their child care assistance payment amount adjusted according to the number of newborn children receiving care, up to a maximum of 3 children."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with Secretary by Sen.

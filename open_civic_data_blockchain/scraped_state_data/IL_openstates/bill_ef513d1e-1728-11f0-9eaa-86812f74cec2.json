Sets forth how the monthly directed payment shall be calculated. Requires the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to adjust and pay community mental health providers for any payments authorized for all services from a community mental health provider which have been paid by a Medicaid managed care organization but no encounter claim has been recorded in the Departments' Enterprise Data Warehouse.

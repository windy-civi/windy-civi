Provides that, upon motion, a court may order that a court file, pleadings, or portions of the court file that are filed under the Act be placed under seal if the court finds that the action or portions of the court file are sufficiently without a basis in fact or law. Provides that this may include, but not be limited to, a lack of jurisdiction or that placing the court file or portions of it under seal is in the interests of justice, and that those interests are not outweighed by the public's interest in the court file. Provides that nothing in the Act allows for the sealing of the court file or any portion of the court file pertaining to whether any order of protection has previously been entered in the proceeding or any other proceeding in which any party, or a child of any party, or both, if relevant, has been designated as either a petitioner, respondent, or protected person. Provides that nothing in the Act allows for or may interfere with the payment of child support, income withholding for support, or the reporting of an entry of an order for support."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.

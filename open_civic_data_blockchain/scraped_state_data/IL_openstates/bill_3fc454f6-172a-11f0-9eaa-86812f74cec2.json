In a provision allowing a service retirement pensioner to be re-employed as a teacher for a specified number of days without cancellation of the service retirement pension, provides that if a service retirement pensioner works more than the number of days allowed under that provision in any school year, the service retirement pension benefit shall be withheld on a pro rata basis for each day worked in excess of the number of days allowed. Provides that if a pensioner who only teaches drivers education courses after regular school hours works more than 900 hours in any school year, the service retirement pension benefit shall be withheld on a pro rata basis for each period of 7.5 hours in excess of 900 hours. Provides that the changes made by the amendatory Act are retroactive to July 1, 2020. Provides that all service retirement pensioners whose service retirement pensions were cancelled as a result of re-employment as a teacher during the period of July 1, 2020 through the effective date of the amendatory Act shall have their overpayments recalculated on a pro rata basis consistent with the changes made by the amendatory Act, and the difference between the initial overpayment and the recalculated overpayment shall be refunded to those service retirement pensioners with interest.

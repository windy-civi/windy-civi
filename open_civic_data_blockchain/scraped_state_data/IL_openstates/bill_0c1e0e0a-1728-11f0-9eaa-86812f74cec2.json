In a provision concerning the requirements that a health care professional must meet before he or she can have his or her license placed on volunteer status (rather than being granted a volunteer license), provides that a health care professional must possess an active license that is not currently subject to discipline or under investigation by the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (rather than satisfaction of all requirements of the State licensing Act that applies to his or her health care profession and the rules adopted under the Act). Removes the volunteer licensure fee and removes references to volunteer licenses. Provides that a health care professional whose license is in volunteer status may request that the Department change the status of the license to active as long as the request for the change is made during the same renewal period in which the license was previously active or the license is renewed in the same manner, at the same time, and with the same conditions as an active license. Provides that a health care professional who holds an active license that was previously a volunteer license is subject to the requirements of the State licensing Act that applies to his or her health care profession and the rules adopted under the relevant Act. Provides that the Department may adopt rules for the administration of the provisions regarding volunteer licenses (rather than determining by rule the total number of volunteer licenses to be issued).

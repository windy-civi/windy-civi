Gives the State's Attorney legal standing to represent any and all petitioners if the petitioners request the State's Attorney's assistance in filing the pleadings or in conducting the hearings. Requires a verified pleading (rather than an affidavit or verified pleading). Changes references to an intimate partner to references to a specific intimate partner. In provisions regarding ex parte hearings, requires the court to consider specific evidence and changes the burden of proof from probably cause to a preponderance of the evidence.

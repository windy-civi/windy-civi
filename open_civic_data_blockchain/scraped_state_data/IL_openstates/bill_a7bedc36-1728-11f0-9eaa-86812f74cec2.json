Requires any pharmacy benefit manager or health insurer to provide notice of a change in prescription drug coverage or pricing, including instructions on appeals and exceptions, to beneficiaries of health plans in the State who would be affected by the change. Provides that any pharmacy benefit manager or health insurer must, on or before July 30, 2026, submit to the Department for approval a plan by which beneficiaries may appeal, or request an exception to, a contemplated change in coverage. Provides that this process must allow beneficiaries to present evidence for their appeal or exception.

Provides that if the pharmacy benefit manager or health insurer disputes the changes, a hearing may be requested within 10 days after receipt of the changes, and the Department shall enter a final written decision within 5 days of the hearing."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.

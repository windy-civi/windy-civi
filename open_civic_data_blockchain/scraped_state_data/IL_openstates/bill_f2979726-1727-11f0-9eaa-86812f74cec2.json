Provides that any individual or group policy of accident or health insurance that is delivered, extended, renewed, or modified after January 1, 2026 must provide coverage for at least one 6-month supply of each of the following for each infant covered by the policy: an early egg allergen introduction dietary supplement prescribed by a health care practitioner; and an early peanut allergen introduction dietary supplement prescribed by a health care practitioner. Provides that the coverage shall be provided without cost-sharing, except to the extent the cost-sharing limitation would cause a catastrophic plan to fail to be treated as a catastrophic plan under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or would keep a high-deductible health plan from being treated as a high-deductible health plan or to the extent the cost-sharing limitation would disqualify the plan from a health savings account. Amends the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 and the Medical Assistance Article of the Illinois Public Aid Code to require that coverage.

Beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, requires school boards to publicly report, on their school district's website, a list of the curriculum to be used for student instruction during the school year. Requires that the report also include any procedures that are in effect at each school for the documentation, review, or approval of the curriculum used for student instruction. Allows a school district to update the report on an ongoing basis, but requires the report to be updated at least one month prior to the start of each school semester. Requires the State Board of Education to impose a civil penalty of $1,000 per day for each day a school board fails to post the required update after one week of notice. Requires each school district to notify the parents or guardians of students when the report is posted and when any subsequent updates are made to the report. Makes other changes.

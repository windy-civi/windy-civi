Requires, on or before January 1, 2027, a manufacturer of a product sold, offered for sale, or distributed in the State that contains intentionally added PFAS to submit to the Environmental Protection Agency specified information. Allows the Agency to waive the submission of information required by a manufacturer or extend the amount of time a manufacturer has to submit the required information. Provides that, if the Pollution Control Board has reason to believe that a product contains intentionally added PFAS and the product is being offered for sale in the State, the Board may direct the manufacturer of the product to provide the Board with testing results that demonstrate the amount of each of the PFAS in the product. Provides that, if testing demonstrates that the product does not contain intentionally added PFAS, the manufacturer must provide the Board with a certificate attesting that the product does not contain intentionally added PFAS. Restricts the sale of specified products beginning January 1, 2026 if the product contains intentionally added PFAS. Allows the Agency to establish a fee payable by a manufacturer to the Agency upon submission of the required information to cover the Agency's reasonable costs to implement the provisions.

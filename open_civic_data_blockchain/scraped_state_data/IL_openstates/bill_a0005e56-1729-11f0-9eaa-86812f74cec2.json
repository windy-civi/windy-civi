Provides that 20% of the lesser of (rather than the lesser of): (i) the purchase price or (ii) the fair market value shall constitute the rate base associated with the water or sewer utility as acquired by and incorporated into the rate base of the district designated by the acquiring large public utility, subject to any adjustments that the Illinois Commerce Commission deems necessary to ensure such rate base reflects prudent and useful investments in the provision of public utility service. Provides that the difference between the rate base and the purchase price or fair market value shall be borne by the shareholders of the acquiring large public utility. In provisions concerning the acquisition of a water or sewer utility, provides that, at the next election following the public meeting and notice requirements, a referendum shall be placed on the ballot for all electors within the area the water or sewer utility operates. Provides that, if a majority of the electors voting on the referendum within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in favor of the referendum, then the acquisition may continue. Provides that, if less than a majority of the electors voting on the referendum within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in favor of the referendum, the Commission shall not approve the large public utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility. Removes a provision that provides that the Commission may authorize a water or sewer utility to file a surcharge which adjusts rates and charges to provide for recovery of costs associated with an investment in qualifying infrastructure plant, independent of any other matters related to the utility's revenue requirement.

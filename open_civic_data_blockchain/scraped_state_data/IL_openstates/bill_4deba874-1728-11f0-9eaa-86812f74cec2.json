Requires a Housing Authority that administers a housing voucher program to reimburse a rental property owner for any damage to its rental unit that is caused by a tenant who participates in the housing voucher program. Provides that reimbursement shall be for property damage not covered under a policy of property insurance that is beyond normal wear and tear and that is the result of the tenant's negligence and abuse. Provides that any reimbursement amount paid to a rental property owner shall be repayable by the tenant to the Housing Authority. Permits the Housing Authority to offer and enter into an affordable repayment plan with the tenant. Provides that nothing in the amendatory Act shall be construed to permit a Housing Authority to deny a tenant housing assistance or terminate a tenant's housing voucher based on the tenant having payment obligations under a repayment plan or on a tenant's demonstrated inability to make payments under such a repayment plan."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.

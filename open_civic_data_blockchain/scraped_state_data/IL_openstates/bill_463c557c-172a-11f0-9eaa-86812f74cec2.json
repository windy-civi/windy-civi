Removes language allowing school districts that collect biometric information from students to adopt specified policies. Instead, prohibits a school district from purchasing or otherwise acquiring biometric systems to use on students. Provides that a school district may not do any of the following with respect to students: (1) obtain, retain, possess, access, request, or use biometric systems or biometric information derived from biometric systems; or (2) enter into an agreement with a third party for the purpose of obtaining, retaining, possessing, accessing, or using, by or on behalf of the school district, biometric systems. Provides that, within 30 days after the effective date of the amendatory Act, if a school district is in possession of student biometric information, then the school district shall destroy the biometric information and provide certified documentation of destruction to the State Board of Education. Provides that, within 30 days after the effective date of the amendatory Act, any school district that has contracted with a third party to obtain, collect, or store student biometric information shall require the third party to destroy all biometric information in its possession and confirm in writing the completion of this destruction to the school district. During the 30-day period in which a school district may still have student biometric information in its possession, prohibits the school district from selling, leasing, or otherwise disclosing the biometric information to another person or entity unless: (1) the individual who has legal custody of the student or the student, if he or she has reached the age of 18, consents to the disclosure; or (2) the disclosure is required by court order.

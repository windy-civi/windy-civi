Provides that each applicant for the issuance or renewal (rather than only the issuance) of a Firearm Owner's Identification Card shall (rather than may) provide a full set of the applicant's fingerprints in electronic format to the Illinois State Police, unless the applicant has previously provided a full set of the applicant's fingerprints to the Illinois State Police under the Act or the Firearm Concealed Carry Act.

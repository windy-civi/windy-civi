Changes all references in the General Provisions Article and the Abused, Neglected or Dependent Minors Article of the Act from \"reasonable efforts\" to \"active efforts\" in cases that involve reunification by the Department of Children and Family Services. Defines \"active efforts\" as efforts that are affirmative, active, thorough, timely and intended to maintain or reunite a child with the child's family and represent a higher standard of conduct than reasonable efforts. Provides that \"active efforts\" includes the provision of reasonable efforts as required by Title IV-E of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 670 through 679c). In the court review provisions, provides that if the court makes findings that the Department of Children and Family Services has failed to make active efforts to provide services as provided in the service plan, the court's order shall specify each party that failure applies to and the applicable time period. Amends the Adoption Act. Provides that a person shall not be considered an unfit person for the sole reason that the Department of Children and Family Services or its assign has been found to have not made active efforts as defined in the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 during any period during the pendency of the case at hand. Provides that a parent shall not be found unfit for failure to make reasonable efforts or reasonable progress for any 9-month period during which a court, hearing a case under the Abused, Neglected or Dependent Minors Article of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, found that the Department failed to make active efforts, as defined in the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 with respect to that parent. Provides that this provision applies to findings of failure to make active efforts made on or after the effective date of the amendatory Act."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with Secretary by Sen.

Modifies the definition of \"duty to intervene\" in provisions regarding discretionary termination of Illinois State Police officers. Provides that a member of the Illinois State Police shall not discipline or retaliate in any way against an officer for exercising the officer's duty to intervene, for reporting unconstitutional or unlawful conduct, or for failing to follow what the officer reasonably believes is an unconstitutional or unlawful directive. Amends the Illinois Police Training Act to make similar changes, except that the Law Enforcement Training Standards Board must adopt rules prohibiting members of law enforcement agencies from retaliating. Removes language providing that an individual has no property interest in law enforcement certification at the time of initial certification or at any time thereafter, including, but not limited to, after decertification or after the officer's certification has been deemed inactive. Amends the Local Records Act. Provides that records concerning the automatic expungement of misconduct records where an officer has been found not to have committed any wrongdoing or the complaint was found to be frivolous shall be permanently retained and may not be destroyed. Amends the Police and Community Relations Improvement Act. Repeals provisions allowing a person to file notice of an anonymous complaint to the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board of any conduct the person believes a law enforcement officer has committed."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Prefiled with Clerk by Rep.

Provides that a policeman who applies for disability benefits under the Article and has been denied reinstatement as a policeman by his or her employer because of a physical or mental incapacity shall be presumed to be disabled as that term is used in the Article. Provides that no policeman who otherwise meets the requirements for a disability benefit shall be denied a disability benefit unless and until the policeman's employer reinstates him or her as a policeman or offers him or her a limited-duty position. Provides that any policeman who has been denied a disability benefit without an offer of reinstatement or a limited-duty position after the effective date of the amendatory Act is entitled to disability benefits. Provides that if a policeman has an application for an ordinary disability benefit denied by a majority vote of the Board of Trustees of the Fund or has a duty disability benefit, ordinary disability benefit, or occupational disability benefit terminated by a majority vote of the Board and brings an action for administrative review challenging the termination or denial of the disability benefit and the policeman prevails in the action in administrative review, then the prevailing policeman shall be entitled to recover from the Fund court costs and litigation expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, as part of the costs of the action. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement.

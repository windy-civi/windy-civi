Provides that the Board of Election Commissioners shall change the boundaries of election precincts after each decennial census as soon as practicable following the completion of congressional and legislative redistricting, and such precincts shall contain as nearly as practicable 1,800 registered voters (rather than 1,200 registered voters if the precinct is located in a county with fewer than 3,000,000 inhabitants; or 1,800 registered voters if the precinct is located in a county with 3,000,000 or more inhabitants).
